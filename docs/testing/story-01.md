# Story 1 Testing: Project Setup & Basic Server

## **User Story:**
As a developer, I want to set up the basic project structure with Express.js server, so that I have a solid foundation for the application.

## **Acceptance Criteria Testing:**

### **✅ AC-1: Express.js server running on port 5000**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
npm run dev
EADDRINUSE: ❌ Port 5000 is already in use
🔧 Fix Port Issue:
Step 1: Find what's using port 5000
bash# Check what's running on port 5000
lsof -i :5000
# OR
ps aux | grep node
Step 2: Kill the existing process
bash# Kill any process using port 5000
pkill -f node
# OR if you see a specific PID from lsof:
# kill [PID_NUMBER]
### **✅ AC-1: Express.js server running on port 5000**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
npm run dev
Expected Result: Server starts and shows "running on port 5000" in console
Status: [x] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL
Notes:

Issue Encountered: EADDRINUSE error - port 5000 already in use (initial attempt)
Resolution: Killed existing node processes with pkill -f node
Outcome: Server started successfully after clearing port
Final Result: Excellent startup with detailed logging:

✅ Server running on port 5000
✅ Environment: development
✅ Health check endpoint available
✅ CORS enabled
✅ Error handling active
✅ Enhanced logging enabled

### **✅ AC-2: Basic folder structure created**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
ls -la src/
ls -la public/
ls -la database/

Expected Result: Folders exist: src/routes, src/models, src/middleware, public/css, public/js, database/
Status: [x] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL
Notes:

src/ folder: ✅ Contains all required subdirectories:

routes/, models/, middleware/ (required)
utils/ (bonus folder)


public/ folder: ✅ Contains all required subdirectories:

css/, js/ (required)
assets/ (bonus folder)


database/ folder: ✅ Exists (empty, ready for Story 2)
Result: All acceptance criteria met, plus additional useful folders

### **✅ AC-3: Package.json with core dependencies**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
cat package.json | grep -A 10 "dependencies"

Expected Result: Contains express, cors, dotenv, sqlite3, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, body-parser
Status: [x] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL
Notes:

All Required Dependencies Present:

✅ express (^4.18.2)
✅ cors (^2.8.5)
✅ dotenv (^16.3.1)
✅ bcryptjs (^2.4.3)
✅ jsonwebtoken (^9.0.2)
✅ body-parser (^1.20.2)
✅ path (^0.12.7)


Bonus Dependencies:

@types/cors, @types/express, @types/node (TypeScript support)


Note: sqlite3 dependency might be in devDependencies or installed separately
## 📋 **Quick Check for sqlite3:**

```bash
cat package.json | grep sqlite3
"sqlite3": "^5.1.6"
### **✅ AC-4: Environment variable support**
**Status:** [x] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL  
**Notes:**
- **Evidence**: Server startup shows "Environment: development"
- **dotenv**: Included in dependencies (^16.3.1)
- **No errors**: No environment variable errors in console
- **Replit Secrets**: Integration working (PORT, NODE_ENV, etc.)

### **✅ AC-5: CORS configuration for cross-origin requests**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
curl -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" -v http://localhost:5000/api/health

### **✅ AC-5: CORS configuration for cross-origin requests**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
curl -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" -v http://localhost:5000/api/health

✅ AC-6: Basic health check endpoint (/api/health)
Test Steps:
bashcurl http://localhost:5000/api/health
Expected Result: Returns JSON with message, timestamp, version, status
Status: [X] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL
{"status":"healthy","message":"🚗 Driver Log App Server is running!","timestamp":"2025-07-22T05:34:23.295Z","version":"2.0.0","environment":"development","database":true,"uptime":1634.661640211,"port":"5000"}

✅ AC-7: Error handling middleware
Test Steps:
bashcurl http://localhost:5000/nonexistent
Expected Result: Returns 404 error with proper error message
Status: [x] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL
Notes:

Error Response Structure: ✅ Proper JSON format returned
HTTP Status: ✅ 404 Not Found (confirmed by curl behavior)
Error Fields Present:

✅ error: "Not Found" (error type)
✅ message: "Route GET /nonexistent not found" (descriptive message)
✅ path: "/nonexistent" (request path tracking)
✅ timestamp: "2025-07-22T05:53:54.511Z" (ISO timestamp)


Result: Error handling middleware properly catches 404 errors and returns structured JSON response

✅ AC-8: Console logging for debugging
Test Steps:
bash# Start server and make requests, observe console output
npm run dev
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
Expected Result: Console shows request logs with status codes and timestamps
Status: [x] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL
Notes:

Console Logging Present: ✅ Comprehensive logging system active
Request Logging Evidence:

✅ [2025-07-22T03:18:39.985Z] GET / - IP: 172.31.109.66 (method, path, IP)
✅ [2025-07-22T03:18:39.986Z] 404 - Route GET / not found (status code, error detail)


Server Events Logged:

✅ 🚀 Server started successfully (startup logs)
✅ 📡 Environment: development (environment info)
✅ 🔗 Health check available at: http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/health (endpoint info)
✅ 📝 Enhanced logging enabled (logging confirmation)
✅ 🔄 Replit keep-alive ping (periodic maintenance logs)
✅ 🛑 SIGTERM received, shutting down gracefully (shutdown logs)


Timestamp Format: ✅ ISO format with milliseconds precision
Status Codes: ✅ 404 errors properly logged
Debugging Info: ✅ IP addresses, routes, and error messages included
Result: Comprehensive console logging system working perfectly for debugging
