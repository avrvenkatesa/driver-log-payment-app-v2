## **User Story:**
As a driver, I want to request leave for specific dates, so that my absences are properly recorded.

---

## **Acceptance Criteria Testing:**

### **✅ AC-1: Leave requests table in database**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Check database schema for leave_requests table
sqlite3 database/driver_logs.db ".schema leave_requests"
# Verify foreign key constraint and unique constraint
sqlite3 database/driver_logs.db "PRAGMA foreign_key_list(leave_requests);"
sqlite3 database/driver_logs.db "SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE name='leave_requests';"
```

### **✅ AC-7: Leave request history endpoint**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Get leave requests for current year
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/driver/leave-requests/2025

# Get leave requests without year parameter (should default to current year)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/driver/leave-requests
```
**Expected Result:** Returns driver's leave requests with proper formatting and leave balance information  
**Status:** [X] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL  
**Notes:** EXCELLENT! Leave history endpoint working perfectly:
- Proper JSON response with success: true ✅
- Year parameter working: year: 2025 ✅

- Complete request summary: totalRequests: 2, pendingRequests: 2 ✅

### **✅ AC-8: Annual leave balance tracking**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Check leave balance calculation after submitting annual leave
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/driver/leave-requests/2025

# Verify balance calculation logic (12 - used annual leaves)
# Submit multiple annual leave requests and check balance updates
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/driver/leave-request \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"leave_date": "2025-08-20", "leave_type": "annual", "reason": "Balance test"}'

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/driver/leave-requests/2025
```
**Expected Result:** Shows remaining annual leave balance (12 - used), only counts annual leave types  
**Status:** [X] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL  
**Notes:** PERFECT! Annual leave balance tracking working correctly:
- Total annual leave: 12 days ✅
- Used annual leave: 0 (sick leave doesn't count toward annual limit) ✅
- Remaining balance: 12 (correct calculation: 12 - 0) ✅
- Balance year tracking: year: 2025 ✅
- Leave type logic: sick leave (ID:2) not affecting annual balance ✅
- Annual leave (ID:1) properly tracked but still pending ✅

## **Additional Business Logic Testing:**

### **Leave Type Impact on Balance:**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Verify sick and emergency leaves don't affect annual balance
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/driver/leave-requests/2025
```
**Expected Result:** Annual balance only decreases for annual leave types, not sick/emergency  
**Status:** [ ] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL  
**Notes:** ________________________________

### **Date Validation Testing:**
**Test Steps:**
```bash

# Test future date limit (>1 year)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/driver/leave-request \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"leave_date": "2027-08-15", "leave_type": "annual", "reason": "Far future test"}'
```
**Expected Result:** Rejects past dates and dates too far in future with appropriate error messages  
**Status:** [ ] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL  
**Notes:** ________________________________

### **Authentication and Authorization:**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Test without authentication token
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/driver/leave-request \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"leave_date": "2025-08-25", "leave_type": "annual", "reason": "No auth test"}'

# Test with invalid token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token" -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/driver/leave-request \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"leave_date": "2025-08-25", "leave_type": "annual", "reason": "Invalid auth test"}'
```
**Expected Result:** Returns 401 Unauthorized for missing/invalid authentication  
**Status:** [ ] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL  
**Notes:** ________________________________

### **Database Integrity Testing:**
**Test Steps:**
```bash

sqlite3 database/driver_logs.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leave_requests WHERE driver_id = (SELECT id FROM drivers WHERE phone = '+1234567890');"

# Check unique constraint enforcement
sqlite3 database/driver_logs.db "SELECT driver_id, leave_date, COUNT(*) FROM leave_requests GROUP BY driver_id, leave_date HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;"
```
**Expected Result:** Foreign keys properly linked, no duplicate (driver_id, leave_date) combinations  
**Status:** [ ] ✅ PASS [ ] ❌ FAIL  
**Notes:** ________________________________
