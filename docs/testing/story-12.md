## **API Enhancement Testing:**

### **Enhanced API Response Structure:**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Verify API returns enhanced timestamp information
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/driver/leave-requests/2025
```
**Expected Enhanced Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "leaveRequests": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "leave_date": "2025-08-25",
        "leave_type": "annual",
        "reason": "Enhanced testing",
        "status": "pending",
        "requested_at": "26/07/2025, 09:22:00 am IST",
        "requested_timestamp": "2025-07-26T03:52:00.000Z",
        "formatted_time": "9:22 AM"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Database Schema Verification:**
**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Verify timestamp precision in database
sqlite3 database/driver_logs.db "SELECT id, leave_date, leave_type, status, requested_at, datetime(requested_at, 'localtime') as local_time FROM leave_requests ORDER BY requested_at DESC LIMIT 3;"
```
**Expected Result:** Database stores precise timestamps with microsecond accuracy
