# Test with driver token (should fail)
DRIVER_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"identifier":"+1234567890","password":"password123"}' | grep -o '"token":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DRIVER_TOKEN" "http://localhost:5000/api/admin/shifts?filter=today"
```
**Expected:** 403 Forbidden - Admin access required

### **Edge Cases Testing:**
```bash
# Test invalid filter parameter
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" "http://localhost:5000/api/admin/shifts?filter=invalid"

# Test no filter parameter
