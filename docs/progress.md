## **📊 Technical Achievements**

### **API Endpoints Implemented**
```
Authentication:
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/register

Driver Operations:
- GET /api/driver/status
- POST /api/driver/clock-in
- POST /api/driver/clock-out
- GET /api/driver/shifts/:date?
- GET /api/driver/shifts-monthly/:year/:month
- POST /api/driver/leave-request
- GET /api/driver/leave-requests/:year?

Admin Operations:
- GET /api/admin/payroll-config
- POST /api/admin/payroll-config
- GET /api/admin/payroll/:year/:month
- GET /api/admin/payroll/driver/:id/:year/:month
```

### **Database Tables**
```sql
- drivers (authentication, profile data)
- shifts (time tracking, odometer records)
- payroll_config_history (rate management)
- leave_requests (leave management system)
```

### **Business Logic**
- **Overtime Rules**: Sunday (all), Early (<8AM), Late (>8PM)
- **Leave Types**: Annual (counts toward limit), Sick, Emergency
- **Validation**: Odometer continuity, duplicate prevention, date validation
- **Calculations**: Duration, distance, overtime pay, leave balances
